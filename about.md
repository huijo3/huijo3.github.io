I’m always fond of reminiscing about my student life over the past decade. I’m a deeply nostalgic person, often retracing the footsteps of my childhood self. By following the path I’ve already walked, I’ve been piecing together a complete version of myself—one that I believe is inherently complex, far beyond a few simplistic labels.                  

I take great satisfaction in the many "first steps" I’ve taken. Back in middle school, I often doubted myself because I no longer felt as confident as I once was. But over the last four years, I’ve gradually become more active in speeches and hosting events. Though I’ve now grown weary of it and question whether this lifestyle truly suits me, it at least proves that, deep down, I’m still the same person.                     

Through entrepreneurial and cultural exchange activities, I’ve befriended people from Europe and Africa, taking my first real step toward my childhood dream of traveling the world. As a child, I was endlessly fascinated by the idea of flying on an airplane.                   

May my future journey unfold smoothly.
